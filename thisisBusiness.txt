This is my first note hope it will be added in my git repository
So, Lets Talk about what we can do with all the things 
1 Git init
2 git pull ## if required
3 git commit -m "Comment pls"
4 git push origin <branch name> eg.. git push origin main
5 git log ## to check previous commits
6 taking the log id from previous commits we can roll back to previous version
7 git branch to see active branches
8 git checkout <branch name> ## to move to a specific branch
9 # Reset to the specified commit, discarding commits after it
10 git reset --hard a524dcfddb7384f02ce4ca0713566a4105cb59f3
11 # Force-push the changes to the remote repository
12 git push origin main --force
